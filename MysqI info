Inner Join-
Eg- Select Column1,Column2 from table1 1(Alias Name) inner join table 2(Alias Name) ON(Used for menyioning the condition to 
combine the data of 2 table) 1.xname=2.xname;

Outer left join-
Eg-Select column1,column2 from table1 aliasnameoftable1 outer left join table2 aliasameoftable2 ON aliasameoftable1.xname=alias
nameoftable2.xname.
In this it will take the value of null automatically for the right table if their is no record for table2 corresponding to 
table 1.

Outer right join-
Eg-Select column1,column2 from table1 aliasnameoftable1 outer right join table2 aliasameoftable2 ON aliasameoftable1.xname=alias
nameoftable2.xname.
In this it will take the value of null automatically for the left table if their is no record for table1 corresponding to 
table 2.

full outer join-
In this it will display null value for record for both the tables if their is no adequate matching of the two tables in respect
to each other.

Cross join-
It will display the cartesian product.
For eg  table1
        Name      City
        Vishnu    Ajmer
        Arihant   Beawar
        Keshav    Varanasi
        table2
        city        State
        Ajmer       Rajasthan
        Ahmedabad   Gujarat
        Indore      Madhya Pradesh
        
    If we will use cross join, it will dispaly the cartesian product of two tables which is
        Select Name,State from table1 cross join table2;
        No need of using on condition
        
        Name    State
        Vishnu  Rajasthan
        Vishnu  MadhyaPradesh
        Vishnu  Gujarat
        Arihant
        Arihant
        Arihant
        Keshav
        Keshav
        Keshav
        
   Note
   we have to use a group by clause with the aggregate functions if we are display more than a single column.
   Select count(distinct(names)) from empl;
   Select count(distinct(names)),city from empl group by gender;
   
   Eg of using avg aggregate function
   SELECT avg(total_death_cover),gender FROM dbo.MemberCover co inner join dbo.Member mem ON co.total_death_cover=mem.MemberKey
   group by gender;
